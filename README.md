# Triangulation

This project was made as a submission for COL106 course assignment.

This assignment required us to design and implement a model to approximate 3-D shapes using their vertex coordinates in 3-D
space, thereby determining type of mesh, extended neighbours and other related queries.

More information about implementation is given in the src folder.
